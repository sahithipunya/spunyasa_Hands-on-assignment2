# New York House Prices Analysis Project


## Description

This project analyzes a dataset containing information on housing prices in New York using machine learning techniques. The goal is to explore factors affecting house prices, such as property size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and location. 


## Models Developed


## Classification Models:


Logistic Regression


Decision Tree


Random Forest Classifier


Gradient Boosting Classifier


K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Regression Models:


Linear Regression


Random Forest Regressor


Ridge Regression


Lasso Regression 


Elastic Net Regression


Gradient Boosting Regressor


Each model was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared for regression.


All the code for this project is written in Google Colab, an excellent platform for data science and machine learning projects. I highly recommend using Google Colab due to its user-friendly environment and powerful features:
